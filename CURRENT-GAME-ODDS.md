## üö® Instant Game Over

- **Duplicate Trap**: 100% game over (any trap drawn twice = instant death for all)

---

## ‚ú® Relic Mechanics

### Discovery
- **Max Relics**: 3 total in game
- **Discovery Chance**: 10% per round (before all found)
- **Availability**: Next turn after discovery

### Relic Raffle (When Players Escape)

**Raffle Threshold**: `6.5% √ó number of available relics`

Examples:
- 1 relic available: Raffle held if <6.5% of players escape
- 2 relics available: Raffle held if <13% of players escape
- 3 relics available: Raffle held if <19.5% of players escape

**If raffle held**:
- Each escaping player has equal chance to win
- Each player can win max 1 relic
- Multiple relics raffled if available

**If too many escape**:
- No raffle held
- Relics remain in vault

## üíÄ Game End Probabilities

### Expected Game Length

**With 40% trap rate and 50% loot rate:**
- Expected traps per round: 0.4
- Expected unique traps before duplicate: ~3.67
- Rounds between traps: ~2.5
- **Expected game length**: ~9-10 rounds before duplicate

**With elimination (20-70% rates):**
- Player count drops dramatically
- All eliminated in ~12-15 rounds (if no duplicate hit first)

### Ways Game Can End

1. **Duplicate Trap** (Most likely): ~80%
   - Probability increases with each trap
   - After 3 unique traps: ~50% chance next trap is duplicate

2. **All Players Eliminated** (Moderate): ~15%
   - Requires 4-5 unique traps without duplicate
   - High elimination rates + no escapes

3. **Prize Pool Depleted** (Very rare): <5%
   - Would need 25+ loot rounds
   - Extremely unlikely

4. **Player Escapes** (You decide): Variable
   - Strategic choice
   - Usually happens rounds 5-10

## üßÆ Formula Summary

**Elimination Rate**: `10% + (uniqueTrapTypes √ó 10%)`

**Escape Bonus**: `totalLoot √ó 12%`

**Player Loot**: `totalLoot √ó 88% √∑ playerCount`

**Escape Rate Base (AI)**:
- `5%` if loot ‚â• $10k
- `0.1% - 5%` if loot < $10k (trap dependent)

**Duplicate Probability**: `uniqueTrapTypes √∑ 6`

**Relic Raffle Threshold**: `6.5% √ó availableRelics`

---

## üé≤ Luck Factor

**High Variance Elements**:
1. Loot percentage (20-60% range)
2. Trap timing (when duplicates hit)
3. Relic discoveries (10% chance)
4. AI escape timing (can swing 20-40%)

**More Predictable**:
1. Elimination rates (fixed percentages)
2. Escape bonus (always 12%)
3. Duplicate probability (deterministic)
